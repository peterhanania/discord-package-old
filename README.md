# discord-package
A more detailed discord data package explorer inspired by https://ddpe.androz2091.fr/.  Very easy to host, does not store any information about the user .

### This only works on local host because I was sending the zip to the backend. It also only shows you a json of your data. I will update it sometime soon to read the file from the front end and to style.
